      Along with five others, you went aboard spaceship YTH52 to gather information on the newly discovered planet, XW37129T56. 
      Everything went smoothly and in just a few years, you managed to safely reach your destination. 
      Everything was going according to plan. 
      When it came time to return home, to Earth, you and the crew packed up and set off. 
      On the way, however, there was an unfortunate accident where the ship suffered significant damages and the crew members became lost in space. 
      Fortunately, you didn't go too far from the spaceship, but most of the food was lost. 
      The ship couldn't be operated and you don't know how to fix it, so you had to go out on your own to gather the food and find the others.
      <br />
      <br />
      As an astronaut, there are a few things you should know before you go.
      <br />
      One, be aware of the gravational pull of things like asteroids.
      <br />
      Two, do NOT stray too far from the spaceship.
      <br />
      Three, things may not be as they seem.
